#= Radial binner to bin gas information in each galaxy/halo radially.

This needs to do maybe 3 functionalities
1. Get isotropically averaged radial bins
2. Get variance in each angle assuming a fixed axis
    Likely assuming off x-axis (1st index)
3(maybe). Get spherical bins in all 3 dimensions: radius and
two angles.
